# Subspace Distribution Adaptation Framework

This repository provides the pdf file of the paper "Subspace distribution adaptation frameworks for domain adaptation" published in IEEE TNNLS.
In a nutshell, this paper introduces the generalized covariate shift assumption to the domain adaptation problem, and proposed a subspace distribution adaptation framework that aligns the source distribution to the target distribution under the Bregman divergence in a subspace. By properly choosing the seed function of the Bregman divergence, the framework can lead to convex optimization problems.
