# Subspace Distribution Adaptation Frameworks

This repository provides the pdf file of the paper "Subspace distribution adaptation frameworks for domain adaptation" published in IEEE TNNLS.

In a nutshell, this paper introduces the generalized covariate shift assumption to the domain adaptation problem, and proposes subspace distribution adaptation frameworks that aligns the source distribution to the target distribution in a subspace. By properly choosing the seed function or loss function, the frameworks can lead to convex optimization problems.
